## Web Related APP in Go
The repository includes two kinds of web APP written in Go. 

Web crawler - Use [fetchbot] and [goquery]. The content of source code is based on the example of fetchbot.

Web Service - Use [go-martini] and the extension "render" to build up a light-weight web service. Basically, I follow the lessons on [gophercasts].

Others - I choose SQLite as I/O for two apps.
